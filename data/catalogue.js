// event types are actually present) comes from the API. The stable half is the
// documented request vocabulary, which is part of the contract rather than the
// data. A catalogue is fetched once per process: it changes on the scale of
// releases, not queries, and a research run should not spend requests on it.

// From the documented stable indexes in Marked's agent contract.
